# WeatherApp

This is a weather app where users can type and check any location's weather worldwide.
Android Studio Code was utilized to complete this project, so this weather app only works on the Android Studio Code.
In order to run this project, you need to open the Android Studio Code application and on the top-right corner, you press the play button.
When the Weather App is open, there'll be a search bar to type the location. There is also a "5-day forecast" button where the user can access and see the weather temperature for the next five day. The user can also press the "get weather using gps" where they can detect and check their location's weather.

At the buttom of the app, there is a another button which includes the company's background.
